This is a project I completed a while ago which takes every single stat, weapons and pathway from the hit FromSoftware game Dark SOuls 3. The project was completed using python and other libraries consisting of Numpy, Pandas etc. and was formed in a jupyter notebook.

To run the program simply follow these steps:

1. clone the repository into your machine and open it in whatever IDE you use.
2. start by making sure the csv containing all the data gets read (just run the csv file).
3. Next run the program cell by sell to form the visuals like charts and graphs, and the data I spliced
4. Enjoy your run Ashen One!

Another thing the project highlights is proper citationa along with ethical use of generative AI.
This cant be stressed enough considering that a lot of the time you can finish these projects extremely quickly which somepletely disregarding any understanding

You will find thorough explanation of each process throughout each notebook block and all references have been made at the end of the file.
