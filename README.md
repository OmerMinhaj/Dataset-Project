This is a project I completed a while ao which takes every single stat, weapons and pathway from the hit FromSoftware game Dark SOuls 3. The project was completed using python and other libraries consisting of Numpy, Pandas etc. and was formed in a jupyter notebook.

To run the program simply follow these steps:

1. clone the repository into your machine and open it in whatever IDE you use.
2. start by making sure the csv containing all the data gets read (just run the csv file).
3. Next run the program cell by sell to form the visuals like charts and graphs, and the data I spliced
4. Enjoy your run Ashen One!
